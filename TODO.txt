- Warn if unsaved changes (See:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9872988/prevent-navigating-to-another-view-if-contents-are-unsaved)
- Fix bug where UTF-8 string representation length and file size disagree
- Fix bug where file size is not updated when file is saved (the directory
  hierarcy has do idea when files are saved, someone should handle the syncing
  of File and DirectoryEntry that represent the same file)
- Make it possible to rename files and find out how Backbone's RESTfulness copes
  with that!
- Click on a directory in the breadcrumb.  It will "load" the directory as a
  file.  Try to save the file.  Ugly error is reported.  (EISDIR)
- Don't even try to edit binary files (find out somehow that they are)

Done:

- Add router
- Add hierarcy
- Separate file entries (= [name, length]) from file contents (= [name, content])
  to avoid loading all files on start
